# open robotic metaverse
### Introduction 
In today’s rapidly evolving technological landscape, robotics stands at the forefront of innovation, driving advancements across numerous sectors. However, the journey into robotics is fraught with barriers, notably the steep
learning curve and the substantial investment. Recognizing these challenges, we propose the creation of an open
robotic metaverse—a web-based collaborative platform designed to revolutionize how individuals and organizations
engage with robotics. By leveraging the power of open-source tools, our project aims to make robotics universally
accessible, fostering a community of collaboration among students, researchers, and professionals alike. This initiative not only democratizes access to robotics but also harnesses the collective intelligence of a global community to
push the boundaries of what is possible in this field
